Design for Software Download Pack
=======
The files included in this download pack are meant to compliment the Design for Software text. Everything in this folder maps to the appropriate sections in the book. I encourage you to read the text first to understand the purpose of the files before using them. But even if you don't read the book, these files are meant to help you save some time throughout the design process in your own projects.

This pack includes several different files: 
* **Design Templates** - There are a handful of blank templates to print out and use for your own projects.
* **Design Samples**  -  These files are sample executions of a particular topic. Some of the topics include: wireframes, color palettes, and design patterns. I've included both the original artwork illustrator files (.ai) and .pdf versions for reuse as needed. 
* **Code Samples** - I've included a couple of proof of concepts demonstrating how to various creative coding tasks.

Additionally, these samples and other can be seen live and downloaded from

How do I use them?
-------

Open them, pick them apart, steal what you need, leave what you don't. I spent many man hours hand crafting all of figures in the book. Nothing would make me happier than to see other people put them to good use.  If you do something great with them please send me and email at eklimcz@gmail.com so I can check it out.  


Enjoy!
Erik
